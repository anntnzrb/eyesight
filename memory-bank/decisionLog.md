## Decision

[2025-05-06 02:31:30] - Refactored `eyesight.gemini.session.create_session` to be an asynchronous context manager.

## Rationale

*   The `google-genai` library's `gemini.client.aio.live.connect()` method returns an asynchronous context manager.
*   To correctly use this and resolve Pylance errors ("is not awaitable"), `create_session` must also be an async context manager.
*   This ensures proper resource management for the Gemini API session.

## Implementation Details

*   Added `@asynccontextmanager` decorator from `contextlib` to `create_session`.
*   Modified `create_session` to use `async with ... as session:` and `yield session`.
*   Updated the return type hint of `create_session` to `AsyncIterator[GeminiLiveSession]`.
*   Updated the docstring of `create_session` to reflect its usage as a context manager.
*

## Decision

[2025-05-06 02:52:57] - Used `types.Modality.AUDIO` for `response_modalities` in `eyesight/config/settings.py`.

## Rationale

*   The `google-genai` library's `types.LiveConnectConfig` expects a list of `types.Modality` enum members for the `response_modalities` parameter.
*   A `TypeError` was raised because a list of strings (e.g., `["audio"]`) was being passed.

## Implementation Details

*   Modified the `live_config` property within the `GeminiConfig` class in `eyesight/config/settings.py`.
*   Changed the line `response_modalities=["audio"],` to `response_modalities=[types.Modality.AUDIO],` to correctly use the enum member.
