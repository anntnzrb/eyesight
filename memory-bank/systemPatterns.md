## Guiding Philosophy

The principles outlined in this document are fundamentally guided by the tenet that concise code, often achieved through functional programming paradigms, leads to a reduced long-term maintenance burden. While immediate readability is a consideration, it is balanced against the benefits of a smaller codebase and can be effectively supported by strong code structure and targeted documentation where needed.

## Information Patterns

*   **Prioritizing Current Knowledge:**
    *   Actively seek and prioritize up-to-date external information for all aspects of development, including technologies, libraries, programming language versions, and best practices. Internal knowledge bases can quickly become outdated; therefore, external, current sources are favored.
    *   Utilize available mechanisms to access the latest information. For instance, MCPs (Model Context Protocol servers) like Context7 can be employed to search for and retrieve current documentation for libraries and technologies.

## Coding Patterns

*   **Programming Paradigm Principles:**
    *   Prefer functional over imperative: Emphasize 'what' needs to be done over 'how'. Functional approaches often lead to more concise code, contributing to reduced maintenance. While sometimes perceived as less initially readable, this can be mitigated with good documentation and familiarity.
    *   Immutability: Favor immutable data structures and pure functions where appropriate.
    *   Static typing: Utilize static type checking systems where available to enhance code robustness, improve maintainability, and help prevent errors.
*   **Code Quality Principles:**
    *   Idiomatic implementation: Use language-specific idioms and best practices.
    *   Conciseness: Prioritize reducing code length to minimize long-term maintenance, without unduly sacrificing clarity. Well-structured code and targeted documentation can support understanding of concise implementations.
    *   Latest language features: Implement modern language features that improve development experience.
    *   Self-documenting code: Use descriptive naming and clear structure.
    *   Minimal comments: Only add comments for non-intuitive sections; avoid documenting the obvious.
    *   Naming conventions: Follow established patterns and maintain consistency throughout the project.
    *   Proper logging: Use appropriate logging frameworks instead of print statements for debugging.
    *   Debug cleanup: Remove debugging code after issues are resolved.
*   **Python-Specific Practices:**
    *   **Type Hinting:** Emphasize comprehensive use of Python's type hinting (e.g., via the `typing` module) for all new code to improve clarity, enable static analysis, and help catch errors early.
    *   **Functional Programming Emphasis:**
        *   Actively prefer functional programming constructs and idioms over imperative loops, as they often result in more concise and thus more maintainable code in the long run, even if requiring careful documentation for complex cases.
        *   Leverage Python's built-in functional tools (e.g., `map`, `filter`, list comprehensions, generator expressions) and lambdas effectively.
        *   Make appropriate use of the `itertools` and `functools` standard libraries to implement functional patterns efficiently and expressively, often leading to more performant and concise code.
    *   **Recursion Over Loops (Mindfully):** Consider recursion as an alternative to complex iterative loops for problems naturally suited to it. Always be mindful of Python's recursion depth limits and potential performance implications for very large datasets.
    *   **Performance-Aware Functional Programming:** While favoring functional approaches, if a functional implementation is identified as a clear performance bottleneck, pragmatic imperative solutions or optimized algorithms (potentially with caching strategies) should be considered. Performance profiling should guide such decisions.
    *   **Concise and Idiomatic Control Flow:** Strive for idiomatic Python for control flow, aiming for maximum conciseness to reduce maintenance. Utilize conditional expressions, dictionary-based dispatch, and other Pythonic patterns as alternatives to verbose `if/elif/else` chains, ensuring clarity is maintained or supported by documentation.

## Architectural Patterns

*   **Core Architectural Principles:**
    *   Modularization: Decompose large code units (e.g., files, classes, components) into smaller, focused, and cohesive modules to improve organization and maintainability.
    *   Low coupling/high cohesion: Ensure modules are independent with related functionality grouped together.
    *   Forward-compatible design: Structure code to accommodate future expansion.
